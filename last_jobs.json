They maintain a continuous improvement cycle by managing a critical feedback loop between operations and customers, drawing insights from multiple sources including quality auditors, side-by-side observations, and metric analysis. Through regular side-by-side sessions, they identify opportunities for workflow enhancement and quality improvements. The specialists serve as key escalation points for customer concerns, providing strategic recommendations based on their deep understanding of processes. They consistently evaluate quality tools, suggesting refinements to enhance effectiveness, while simultaneously maintaining and updating process documentation to ensure standardization and clarity across all workflows.
