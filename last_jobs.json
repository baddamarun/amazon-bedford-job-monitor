You’ll collaborate with many internal customers who depend on your models to be effective themselves, and you'll work closely with these teams to push the boundaries of how we're using modeling to build successful products.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eYou will thrive in this role if you:\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e- Are an expert in modeling SoCs, ASICs, TPUs, GPUs, or CPUs\u003cbr/\u003e- Are comfortable modeling in C++ or SystemC, and familiar with Python\u003cbr/\u003e- Enjoy learning new technologies, building software at scale, moving fast, and working closely with colleagues as part of a small team within a large organization\u003cbr/\u003e- Want to jump into an ML-aligned role, or get deeper into the details of ML at the hardware/system-level\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eAlthough we are building machine learning chips, no machine learning background is needed for this role. This role spans modeling of the ML and management regions of our chips, and you’ll dip your toes into both.
