Data center managers come to Boost to monitor, prioritize, assign, and audit work. AWS Service Owners come to Boost to request work and receive feedback on its progress towards completion. They want capacity available and (back) in service quickly, safely, and frugally. Our services drive this outcome by matching incoming requests with the ideal set of instructions, allocating the needed materials, and providing Data Center Operators with the tooling needed to plan, schedule, and audit the work.
