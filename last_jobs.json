Die „Last-Mile-Logistik“ liefert unsere Pakete in Partnerschaft mit Drittanbietern und realisiert zahlreiche Initiativen zur kontinuierlichen Verbesserung, um Millionen von Kunden zufrieden zu stellen.\u003cbr/\u003eUnser Ziel ist es, das Liefererlebnis für unsere Kund:innen so reibungslos wie möglich zu machen und globale Lieferlösungen für unsere neuesten Angebote einzuführen.\u003cbr/\u003eUnsere Arbeit lässt sich in zwei Sparten unterteilen. „Under the Roof“ betrifft alles was innerhalb unserer Logistikstandorte passiert und „On the Road“ alles was in den Liefergebieten auf der Straße stattfindet. Unsere Mitarbeitenden bereiten die Pakete in entsprechenden Schichten (Nacht, Früh, Spät) auf den täglichen Versand an unsere Lieferteams vor und kümmern sich um Retouren, die nicht ausgeliefert werden konnten.\u003cbr/\u003eJedes Jahr setzen wir neue Maßstäbe in puncto Kundenerlebnis und bieten neue, innovative Lieferdienste an. Wir suchen nach neuen Möglichkeiten, um branchenweite Logistikherausforderungen zu überwinden, sowie nach neuen Ideen, um unseren CO2-Fußabdruck zu reduzieren. Ein Fuhrpark innovativer Fahrzeuge (einschließlich E-Fahrzeugen) und modernste Technologie unterstützen uns dabei.","department_cost_center":null,"description_short":"Produktionsleiter / Operations Manager / Logistikmanager / Quality Manager oder vergleichbar als Area Manager:in für unsere Delivery Station in Freiburg gesucht!
