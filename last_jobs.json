To spearhead this initiative, we are actively seeking experienced systems engineers with a strong background in cloud operations. As part of the AWS Managed Operations team, you will play a pivotal role in building and leading operations and development teams dedicated to delivering high-availability AWS services, including EC2, S3, Dynamo, Lambda, and Bedrock, exclusively for EU customers.

As a responsible engineer, you’ve learned never to make changes to production systems without a plan, so you reviewed then executed changes following a change management process to one of the production systems in your care. Later in the week, you help to resolve your team’s backlog of operational issues. You round off the week by writing a cool script that you shared with your team which helps get to root cause faster of a hard problem that you diagnosed earlier.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eYou will be required to occasionally participate in an “on-call” rotations to resolve incidents occurring out-of-hours.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eEligibility requirement \u003cbr/\u003e* Fluency in written and spoken English is required. \u003cbr/\u003e* Candidate must be a national of an EU member state and residing in the EU to operate the AWS European Sovereign Cloud.\u003cbr/\u003e* Amazon will provide relocation support for successful applicants relocating within the European Union.\u003cbr/\u003e* Employees will participate in an On-Call rota.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eAbout the team\u003cbr/\u003eDiverse Experiences \u003cbr/\u003e AWS values diverse experiences.
