Drivers come into the DS and pick up the packages for their route and deliver them to Amazon’s customers. This operation is also called the “Last Mile”. An integral component in the Last Mile ecosystem are Amazon's WW delivery hubs where packages are received, sorted and prepared for on-road delivery. Station Tech team, in Last Mile, is responsible for building scalable tools and technology for delivery hubs that scale across multiple programs and businesses including Amazon Logistics (AMZL), Global Specialty Fulfilment (GSF), to increase associate productivity, site throughput, and operational quality and scalability of our delivery network. Our primary customers are delivery station associates (our actual on-ground rockstars who sort millions of packages a day), station managers (who manage Amazon hubs WW to ensure customer promises are met), COs (central operations team who supervise stations across regions) and on-road delivery agents (drivers who sail through all obstacles to get your packages at your doorstep).

The induct stow team continuously innovates for the customers and invests in furthering our architectural foundation to enable business growth, and strategic business initiatives for the next-generation \"Last Mile\" hubs WW.
