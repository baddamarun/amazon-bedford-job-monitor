You will be responsible for creating and executing test programs, plans, and methods for both subsystem verification tests and complete system verification and validation tests to support new technology and product development programs. This includes developing and executing: design verification test (DVT) plans, factory and site acceptance testing (FAT/SAT), scaled verification tests, test fixtures, and designing experiments (DOE) to support design validation and verification, design down-selection, conducting reliability testing, and driving continuous improvement initiatives.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThese component and system-level processes integrate sensors, actuators, mechanisms, controls, computer, electrical, and human interactions to deliver systems that meet and exceed customer, safety, regulatory, and business requirements.

You might start your morning reviewing test results from overnight automated data collection, then collaborate with hardware engineers to refine a test fixture design for a new sensor configuration. In the afternoon, you could be executing a design of experiments study to down-select between material options, or working with controls engineers to diagnose an electro-mechanical issue affecting machine reliability. You’ll travel to Amazon sites across North America to execute tests and collect data, collaborating closely with program and site stakeholders.
